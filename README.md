####   Workflow

![workflow](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggjqqii5ezj30u016harm.jpg)

####   Core Value

- ##### Faster : You don't have to be late on class for long, boring printing process. Go faster and take a look your lecture notes once more!

- ##### Easier : You don't have to consume your energy in front of printing computers and printers anymore! Just upload your files with your mobile phone on the way you go to your school:)

- ##### Together : We know your difficulties of your college life,,, cuz we are students as well. So, why don't we go forward together?! 

------

### Coding Convention

  based on [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). Some key rules are below.

#### Layout

#####   Indentation and Spacing

- use 2 spaces for indentation.![·Ñâ·Ö≥·Ñè·Ö≥·ÑÖ·Öµ·Ü´·Ñâ·Ö£·Ü∫ 2020-06-30 ·Ñã·Ö©·Ñí·ÖÆ 5.17.55](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggae1yvl1sj317g0hun3h.jpg)

- use a whitespace( ) not in front of but only after colon(:).

  - example 

    `let name: String`

#####   Line breaking

- if max length of a line exceeded, line breaking should be after last word is finished.

- if max length of a line exceeded during function calling, line breaking should be based on parameters. cf, if parameters have more than double closures, line must be breaked.

- nothing except last closure can be on same position with first letter of block.

  - example

    ```swift
    guard let pvc = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewController(
    	identifier="secondVC") as? SecondViewController
    	else {return}
    ```

#####   Max length of a line

- a line should not be over 99 letters.![·Ñâ·Ö≥·Ñè·Ö≥·ÑÖ·Öµ·Ü´·Ñâ·Ö£·Ü∫ 2020-06-30 ·Ñã·Ö©·Ñí·ÖÆ 5.20.32](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1ggae2raqjcj30to0ba0uu.jpg)

#####   Blank line

- there should not be whitespaces in blank lines.
- every last line of files should be a blank line.

#####   Import rules

- module import should be sorted internal to external(third party), and alphabet.

------

#### Naming rules

#####   Common

- do not include needless words.
- use `camelCase` not `snake_case`.
- abbreviation should be `UPPERCASE` except being first letter of a word.
- use name based on roles.

#####   Class naming

- use UpperCamelCase in a class name.
- no prefix in class name.

#####   Function naming

- use lowerCamelCase in a function name.

- do not use get, set in function name if possible.

- prefix

  - will : supposed to do an action.
  - did : after a certain action.
  - should : returns a bool value.

- use protocolName in delegate functions.

  - preferred example

  ```swift
  protocol MyCellDelegate {
    func myCellWillPresent(_ cell: MyCell)
    func myCell(_ cell: MyCell, didTapFollowButtonWith user: User)
  }
  ```

  - not preferred example

  ```swift
  protocol MyCellDelegate {
    func willPresent(_ cell: MyCell)
    func myCell(_ cell: MyCell, didTapFollowButtonWith user: User)
  }
  ```

  

#####   Variable naming

- use lowerCamelCase in a variable name.

#####   Constant naming

- use lowerCamelCase in a constant name.

------

#### Comment

- use triple slash(///) for comment

- do not use comment type like C (/* ... */) .

  - preferred example

  ```swift
  /// MARK - IBOutlets
  @IBOutlet weak var tableView: UITableView!
  @IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel!
  ```

  - not preferred example

  ```swift
  /* these are IBOutlets
      that are connected with objects on storyboard */
  @IBOutlet weak var tableView: UITableView!
  @IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel!
  ```

- avoid block comments inline with code.

------

#### Else

- use then to initialize properties of variables during declaration.

  - example

  ```swift
  let nameLabel = UILabel().then{
    $0.backgroundColor = .white
    $0.textColor = .blue
    $0.text = "world"
  }
  ```

------

### Git-Commit Message Convention

####   Commit Type

- feat : add new features
- fix : modify some errors or bugs
- docs : modify documents
- style : format code style or nothing is changed

####   Content

- content should not be over 50 letters and starts with Capital letter.
- do not use past tense but use present tense.
  - preferred example : Fix HomeView
  - not preferred example : Fixed HomeView

------

- Launchscreen.storyboard can't use thirdparty classes like Lottie of Airbnb. In order to make custom splash, SplashViewController is implemented using Lottie. Lottie is library of managing animations using .json files of images like you can see above.

- The application start with Splash view controller and present Log-in view after splash animation is ended.

- splash json file can't handle every devices because they have their own screen size. so, It have to be loaded by different file for different UIScreen size. it was important to figure out boundary of view size by swift programmally.

  ``` swift
    func getLayoutofUserDevice(){
      if(UIScreen.main.bounds.size.width == 375 && UIScreen.main.bounds.size.height == 667){ // i8
        self.splashJsonName = "splash_i8"
      }
      else if(UIScreen.main.bounds.size.width == 414 && UIScreen.main.bounds.size.height == 896){// 11
        self.splashJsonName = "splash_i11"
        
      }
      else if(UIScreen.main.bounds.size.width == 375 && UIScreen.main.bounds.size.height == 812) { // xs
        self.splashJsonName = "splash_xs"
      }
    }
  ```

- After splash animation ended, login view is loaded. in login view, there are two textfield for id / password. Log in button initiate networking with server py POST. With empty textfield, Log in button shows alert and message.
- In sing up view, Name, Id, password and university information is needed to activate Sign up button. Every textfield are checked if it is empty when any textfield ended typing or any buttons are clicked.
- After insert ID textfield, ID check button must be clicked. ID Check button communicate with server by POST action and check if there is a same ID in server. if there is no same ID in server field, small label below textfield will shows that saying it is okay to continue sign up. if there is same ID in server, small label below textfield will notice that there is same ID in server, and textfiled will be cleared.
- After that, In pw field, two textfiled must be filled in same text. Texts are checked when one of two textfiled ended typing. If two text are not same, small label below second textfield will show that pw is incorrect.
- University must selected to locate position of users. 
- After all buttons are clicked, and Every textfield are filled properly, Sign up button will activate. with Sign up button, client send user information to server and recieve results.

          case 2:
            self.progressLabel?.text = "Ïù∏ÏáÑ ÏßÑÌñâ Ï§ëÏù¥ÏóêÏöî!"
            self.jsonName = self.deviceInfo + "_2"
          case 3:
            self.progressLabel?.text = "Ïù∏ÏáÑÍ∞Ä ÏôÑÎ£åÎêòÏóàÏñ¥Ïöî :)"
            self.jsonName = self.deviceInfo + "_3"
            
          default:
            self.progressLabel?.text = "Ïù∏ÏáÑÎ•º ÏãúÏûëÌï¥Î≥ºÍπåÏöî?"

- third item of tabbar presents Order view. which find stores to order printing service using UITableView.

- When view loaded, user send token to server and get store list nearby university. 3 sections are divided by favorite store, recently visited store, and all stores nearby. server give users store list and informations and 3 different sections are implemented by different arrays. 

- Every cells can be selected. when selection occurs, button appears from bottom and disappear when selection canceled.

- Selection cannot  be duplicated. Using  _selectedIndexPath, duplicated selection problems are solved. 

  ```swift
        if indexPath.compare(_selectedIndexPath!) == ComparisonResult.orderedSame{ /*Ïù¥ÎØ∏ ÌÅ¥Î¶≠ÎêòÏñ¥ ÏûàÎäî cellÏùÑ ÌÅ¥Î¶≠*/
          _selectedIndexPath = nil
          clearAllSelections()

- when option change buttons are clicked, option selection view is presented and users can make options for printing files. 

- if user don't set any options, default print use default printing options. 

- option check button present simple view of options. 

- if delete button of cell is clicked, client send a delete message to server.
